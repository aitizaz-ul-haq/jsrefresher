If Statement::
======================
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.



 If-Else Statement:
 ========================
The if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false.


 If-Else If-Else Statement:
 ============================
The if-else if-else statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence and execute the corresponding block of 
code for the first true condition.


  Nested If Statements:
  ======================
  You can nest if statements inside other if or else blocks to handle more complex conditions.


  Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator):
  ==========================================
The ternary operator is a concise way to write if-else statements in a single line.


Truthy and Falsy Values:
=========================
JavaScript has truthy and falsy values. In conditional statements, values are automatically converted to boolean. 
Falsy values are treated as false, and truthy values are treated as true.
