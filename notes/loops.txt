For Loop:
==========

The for loop is commonly used when you know the number of iterations beforehand.

Initialization (let i = 0): Initializes the loop variable.
Condition (i < 5): Specifies the condition for the loop to continue.
Increment (i++): Updates the loop variable after each iteration.


While Loop:
============

The while loop continues as long as a specified condition is true.

Condition (i < 5): Specifies the condition for the loop to continue.

Do-While Loop:
===============

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop but ensures that the block of code is executed 
at least once before checking the condition.

Condition (i < 5): Specifies the condition for the loop to continue.

For-In Loop:
=============

The for-in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

Variable (const key in person): Iterates over the properties of the object.

For-Of Loop:
=============

The for-of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays or strings.
Variable (const color of colors): Iterates over the elements of the iterable.

forEach() Method:
=================

The forEach() method is available on arrays and executes a provided function once for each array element.

Callback Function (function (color)): The function to execute for each element.


Map() Method:
==============
The map() method is similar to forEach() but returns a new array with the results of applying a provided function to each element.

Callback Function (function (number)): The function to execute for each element.
